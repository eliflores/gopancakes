## A Never Ever Ending Love Story


Hello dear pancakes lovers! ü•û

The quest of the dreamy pancakes continues, and it is far from done, because we do not lack excuses to eat delicious
pancakes, and have a good laugh while at it. 

The time arrived for us to visit [A Never Ever Ending Love Story](https://www.anevereverendinglovestory.de/), 
another finding through [Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/VQHy4TMo4nCHrhdh8) üìç

Given that the weather is changing and is now more chilly, we sat inside. We arrived early and got to pick our table. 
However, when we left the place was full and there was a queue to get a table.

They don't only offer pancakes ü•û, but also other breakfast / brunch options. See the menu [here](https://jimdo-storage.global.ssl.fastly.net/file/564a351a-7521-481a-ba21-066ba01f0fda/ENGLISHJULI2023.pdf).
I went with the Butter & maple syrup pancakes. There are other options: Nutella & bananas, Nutella & strawberries, Blueberry compote & vanilla crude, and more!
A side note, after reading the menu more carefully, I got the impression that the menu is designed for the pancakes to be the sweet option, after eating other things. 
There is a section in the menu that says: "HUNGRY? START WITH....", then in another page "CONTINUE WITH...." and finally "YOU CAN‚ÄôT LEAVE THE SHOP
WITHOUT SOMETHING SWEET..." - here, in this last section is where the pancakes are listed. This may be the reason that we only got one pancake. 
While at the restaurant, I went directly to look for the pancakes üòÖ and did not stop at the previous pages.

## The Review

* The Pancakes ü•û
    * Fluffiness: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Spongy enough to nicely absorb the maple syrup. 
    * Maple Syrup: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Very good maple syrup and enough for the pancakes - I had some left at the end.
    * Flavor: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - The flavor was nice, enough buttermilk flavor (buttermilk pancakes are my favorite).
    * Toppings: ‚≠ê - Unless one chooses an option such as Nutella & bananas or Blueberry compote & vanilla crude, the pancakes come with no toppings. Even with the Butter & maple syrup pancakes, a bit of fruit would have been lovely.
    * Extras: ‚≠ê - There were no extras (such as eggs, bacon, etc.) offered along with the pancakes, although there were scrambled eggs on sourdough bread on the menu, and one could order them separately.
* Drinks: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - There are various drinks: coffee, tea, soft drinks. The tea was particularly good.
* The Place üåª
    * Ambiance: I liked the ambiance in general and the decoration was nice.
    * Service: The service was nice, the drinks came very quick, and the pancakes did not last long to arrive either. It may also be related to the fact that we arrived early and there was not a lot of people already.
