## Sweet Love to You


Hello dear pancake lovers! ü•û

We are back with another review!

This time we visited [Love to Sweet You](https://lovetosweetyou.de/) which is another finding through [Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/QHKXKNM8RjK2rNAU6) üìç

The pancakes were very good, see the review below üòã
The place has sitting outside (with an outdoor parasol, for those sunny days ‚òÄÔ∏è) and inside.
They offer a variety of breakfast and lunch options, apart from the pancakes ü•û. See the menu [here](https://cdn.website.dish.co/media/8e/50/6145758/Speisekarte.pdf).

## Our Review

* The Pancakes ü•û
    * Fluffiness: ‚≠ê‚≠ê - The pancakes were rather thin and not of the fluffy kind.
    * Maple Syrup: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Good maple syrup and enough for the pancakes.
    * Flavor: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - The flavor was really nice, enough buttermilk flavor (I love buttermilk pancakes).
    * Toppings: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Berry mix, vanilla cream, vanilla ice cream, nutella, banana. 
    * Extras: ‚≠ê‚≠ê - I think the extras were what I would consider the pancakes toppings (vanilla sauce, fruits, nutella), and there were no extras (such as eggs, bacon, etc.) offered along with the pancakes, although there were scrambled eggs on the menu, and one could order them separately.
* Drinks: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - There are various drinks: coffee, tea, and a homemade ice tea, that I heard from very good sources that it is delicious.
* The Place üåª
    * Ambiance: The ambiance was nice outside were got to sit. The place is located in what I would consider a quiet area, so there was not much noise, ane we could have a nice and very interesting conversation.
    * Service: The service was nice, the drinks came very quick, and I did not have the feeling that the food took long to arrive.
