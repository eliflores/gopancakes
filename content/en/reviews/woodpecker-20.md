## About Woodpacker 20

[Woodpecker 20](https://woodpecker.family/menu-wp20) is the second international entry to the gopancakes guide. 
This time we're visiting Bruxelles, Belgium. This is a nice breakfast place that also serves lunches, but of course 
we're here for the pancakes! üòã

We choose the "IN PANCAKES WE TRUST", which are simple pancackes with syrup, bacon, and... green onions! For 
the pancake purists, having green onions in it may be off putting but I personally found the flavor combination 
interesting. Conveniently, they also offer a small version of this dish called "THE BABY PRESIDENT" for the small hunger 
or for the children in the party.

One thing I'd have loved is a bit more mapple syrup for the quantity of pancake, other than that I found everything really nice.
