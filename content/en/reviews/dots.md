## About dots

[dots](http://ilovedots.de/) is another one of our findings via [Google Maps exploration](https://goo.gl/maps/mXLMDK8YKFynWdUZ6) 📍

After taking a Winter ☃️ break, we went back to the Pancakes scene 🥞 and went to dots in February 2023.

📅 This is a place where it is recommended to make a reservation before visiting, you can make the reservation 
directly on [their website](http://ilovedots.de/) - this worked out pretty well for us ✨

🌱 They offer Vegan and Gluten Free pancakes 💚

## Our Review

* The Pancakes 🥞
    * Fluffiness: ⭐⭐ - the pancakes were rather on the _puffy_ side, like _puffy clouds_ ☁️
    * Maple Syrup: ⭐
    * Flavor: ⭐ - I had the feeling that the flavor of the egg was not balanced out with other ingredients, and it was distinguishable
    * Toppings: ⭐⭐⭐ - fruits, berry compote, maple butter, granola and vanilla cream 
    * Extras: ⭐⭐- bacon, and you can order other things from their menu as well
* Drinks: ⭐⭐⭐ - there is a good variety of drinks (cafe, chai, matcha, golden milk, hot chocolate, ...)
* The Place 🌻
    * Ambiance: the ambiance was intimate, and we managed to have a nice conversation, although there was people in all the tables, the place did not feel crowded.
    * Service: the service was nice, they took good care of us; it took some time to get our Pancakes, but they gave us a heads-up.
