## Lonely Hearts Cafe

Hello pancakes lovers! 🥞

Happy New Year, and happy everything! 🎉

We are back with our first review of the year, although we visited [Lonely Hearts Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ti1Wv7anocxMz1Zt5) last year 😊 we are writing the review now.
We needed the space for the Holidays, and be fully present with family, friends, loved ones.  

We recommend that you arrive early. We went on a Sunday, arrived before they opened and there was already a queue. Once they opened, the place filled up quite quickly.

[This](https://www.lonelyheartsberlin.com/menu) is their menu, in case you want to take a look before your visit.

## The Review

* The Pancakes 🥞
    * Fluffiness: ⭐⭐⭐ - Spongy enough to absorb the maple syrup.
    * Maple Syrup: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Very good maple syrup and enough for the pancakes - we liked that it is served separately, so we can distribute it to our taste.
    * Flavor: ⭐⭐⭐ - The flavor was nice, I would have loved more butter flavor, although they were _Cinnamony_ (is that a word?, you know what I mean, I could savour a nice touch of cinnamon :))
    * Toppings: ⭐ - No toppings, really ... let's go to the Extras section.
    * Extras: ⭐⭐- The extras were mostly on the salty side, and there are various options (sausage, eggs, hash browns). Shout out for the vegan options 🌱
* Drinks: ⭐⭐⭐⭐- Good tea, coffee, milkshakes and cold drinks.
* The Place 🌻
    * Ambiance: When we were there, the place was full, and it was hard to have a deep conversation, as other conversations were going on not far away. Our visit also felt rushed, it felt that we had exceeded the time that we could stay in the table, which is understandable, since there was many people, and a queue.  
    * Service: The service was okay, I would like to try to go again on day and time that is not _rush hour_. The drinks came quick, and the pancakes did not last long to arrive either.
