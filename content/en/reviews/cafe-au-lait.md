## Caf√© au Lait

Hello pancakes enthusiasts! ü•û

This time we visited [Caf√© au Lait](https://www.au-lait.de/).

Before your visit, we recommend to:
* Make a reservation. It's very easy! You can do it via [their website](https://www.au-lait.de/).
* Take a look into [the menu](https://www.au-lait.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Cafe-au-Lait-English-Menu.pdf). Apart from Pancakes, there are other breakfast/lunch/brunch/dinner options.

## The Review

* The Pancakes ü•û
    * Fluffiness: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Not very fluffy.
    * Maple Syrup: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Good Maple Syrup, and enough for the pancakes.
    * Flavor: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - The flavor was good! Buttery flavor, one might find the flavour very sweet, but it was okay for me.
    * Toppings: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - The pancakes are offered in combination with various toppings such as: fruits, mascarpone, caramelized cinnamon apples, and more.
    * Extras: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - A lot of options, as mentioned, they have a lot of things on the menu, apart from the pancakes.
* Drinks: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Good tea, good coffee, hot chocolate, smoothies, juice, lemonades, and more.
* The Place üåª
    * Ambiance: I think one may get a different experience, depending on the location where one is sitting. We were fortunate to get a table at the back, where it was quieter, next to a window, and we had a very nice conversation. We did not feel rushed to leave and could take our time to enjoy our food, drinks, and company.
    * Service: The service was okay. The food and drinks arrived in a reasonable time and the staff was friendly.
