## About Caf√© Krone

[Caf√© Krone](https://www.krone-berlin.com/) was the first place we visited after Tommy's closed.

A friend of Eli's recommended and we decided to give it a try.

## Our Review

* The Pancakes ü•û
    * Fluffiness: ‚≠ê - The weekest point of Krone's Pancakes, they were not fluffy!
    * Maple Syrup: ‚≠ê‚≠ê - Tasty but only available in the Bacon N' Eggs option.
    * Flavor: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
    * Toppings: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
    * Extras: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê -  Salty and sweet alternatives. 
* Drinks: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Good variety, coffee, refreshments and drinks.
* The Place üåª
    * Ambiance: Very cosy, but it can get a bit crowded but it has tables on the outside.
    * Service: Friendly, English speaking, but it was difficult to get their attention as more people came in
