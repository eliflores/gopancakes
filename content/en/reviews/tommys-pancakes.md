## About Tommy's Pancakes and Bistro

[Tommy's Pancakes and Bistro](https://g.page/tommyspancakes?share) is so far our favorite Pancakes place. 

We managed to go a couple of times, and we thought that _this is it_!

And then ... life happened. The place closed 🥹

And, we are once again, in the search of more Pancakes 🥞
