## About Benedict

[Benedict](https://benedict-breakfast.de/) is a breakfast place that we visited in July 2022 üò≥- yes this review
is long overdue ... The story behind this, is that we created GoPancakes after we visited Benedict ü§≠

We used to write our reviews on direct messages in Slack, and at the time there was only three of us trying 
out pancakes. We are now six happy people, and also, one good day, we decided to write our reviews for the whole 
wide World and in the World Wide Web.

We found the place in [Google](https://goo.gl/maps/C7KdykMpgRf2kjFc6), and decided to try it out since the place
is all about breakfast, and they have six different options for pancakes in their menu.

## Our Review

* The Pancakes ü•û
    * Fluffiness: ‚≠ê‚≠ê 
    * Maple Syrup: ‚≠ê
    * Flavor: ‚≠ê‚≠ê - the pancakes were too sweet ... and, next time I would not ask for the additional powdered sugar
    * Toppings: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - they have different options for toppings
    * Extras: ‚≠ê‚≠ê - some options for extras (bacon, different sauces)
* Drinks: ‚≠ê - they have various options, I don't remember the coffee being particularly good, and I do remember that 
there was no ice on the orange juice, and we were not asked if we would like some ice üßä
* The Place üåª
    * Ambiance: The place was sort of crowded, and it was difficult to have a calm and relaxed conversation. 
The place is also in the area where the reception of a Hotel is, so one would see people going to the elevator and people coming and going with their luggage (I guess it'd also depend on where we were seated).
    * Service: It was good, I don't remember it being amazing, but also not awful or bad üòä
