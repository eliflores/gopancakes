## What a Treat

Hello pancakes lovers! ü•û

This time we visited [What a Treat](https://www.what-a-treat-berlin.de/).

Before your visit, we recommend that:
* You make a reservation. It's very easy! You can do it via [the website](https://www.what-a-treat-berlin.de/) or via [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3aDhDSKDDgZaGUyA8). You don't need to reserve very much in advance, we made our reservation on the same day.
* Take a look into [the menu](https://www.what-a-treat-berlin.de/menue/). Apart from Pancakes, there are other breakfast/lunch/brunch options.

## The Review

* The Pancakes ü•û
    * Fluffiness: ‚≠ê‚≠ê - Not so fluffy.
    * Maple Syrup: ‚≠ê‚≠ê - Good Maple Syrup. For 2 out of 3 pancakes orders, we only got Maple Syrup for one üíî. We had to ask for more Maple Syrup.
    * Flavor: ‚≠ê‚≠ê - The flavor was okay. Not a lot of butter flavor.
    * Toppings: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - There were a few options such as: Banana, Blueberries, Nutella, Bacon, Pistachio.
    * Extras: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - A lot of options, as mentioned, they have a lot of things on the menu, apart from the pancakes.
* Drinks: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Good tea, good coffee, smoothies, lemonades, juice.
* The Place üåª
    * Ambiance: The place was full, and it was hard to have a deep conversation (even though, I believe we were not there at _rush hour_). The visit did not felt rushed, or like we had to leave right away. We had the space to order a second round of drinks, and keep chatting. There was nice music in the background.
    * Service: The service was good. The drinks came quick, and the food did not last long to arrive.
