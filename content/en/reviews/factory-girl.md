## About Factory Girl

The specialty of [Factory Girl](https://factorygirl.net/berlin) seems to be vegan and vegetarian dishes.
And so in these lines, we decided to go and try the _Vegan Pancake_ that also happens to be _Gluten Free_ ✨

🌱 If you are looking for a place with Vegan and Gluten Free pancakes, this can be an option!

We visited Factory Girl back in September 2022, another long due review 🤭 that also happened through a
direct message in Slack, and before GoPancakes was created, and before our decision to share our reviews
with the World.

## Our Review

* The Pancakes 🥞
  * Fluffiness: ⭐ - not particularly fluffy
  * Maple Syrup: - no maple syrup 😢
  * Flavor: ⭐⭐
  * Toppings: ⭐⭐ - vegan cream, homemade marmalade, fresh fruit, chocolate chunks, powder sugar
  * Extras: - no extras
* Drinks: ⭐⭐ - Coffee, Tea, some cocktails
* The Place 🌻
  * Ambiance: The place was also crowded, but we did have a chance to talk and have a fun conversation.
  * Service: The service seemed to be a bit slow, or maybe it was just my perception, the time, or my _hungry_ state.
