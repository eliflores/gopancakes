## About Bon Bouquet Cafe

[Bon Bouquet Café](https://g.page/bonbouquet-fr?share) is our first International Adventure, of many, we hope!

It is a _hip_ brunch coffee in Paris 💙 we picked it because we saw it was rated at 4.8 out if 3154 reviews 🙀

Given the rating, and maybe the day and time we chose, we waited for 1 hour in the queue to get a seat.
The wait, though, was worth it. 

The pancakes were very good! Like little pieces of ☁️ in the mouth.
I remember that on the first bite, I could hear [Felicidade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnl-DiE3_gw) from Seu Jorge in my head 😊 


## Our Review

* The Pancakes 🥞
    * Fluffiness: ⭐⭐⭐ - The style of the pancakes was not _extra_ fluffy, and in combination with the butter flavor, they were great.
    * Maple Syrup: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ 
    * Flavor: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ - One can really feel the butter flavor. 
    * Toppings: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Whipped Cream, Coconut/Mango, Chocolate/Berries. In the beginning the whipped cream was good, in the end, it felt too sweet, and next time, I would ask for no whipped cream.
    * Extras: ⭐⭐⭐⭐️ - Fried eggs, bacon.
* Drinks: ⭐⭐⭐ - Coffee, Chocolate, some signature drinks. 
* The Place 🌻
    * Ambiance: The place was very crowded, and it was difficult to have a calm and relaxed conversation. One goes to what one goes: have brunch.
    * Service: Good humor from the staff, since there is so many people, it felt a bit rushed.
