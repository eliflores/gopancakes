## Steel Vintage Bikes Café

[Steel Vintage Bikes Café](https://steel-vintage.com/pages/auguststr-91-in-berlin-mitte) is another 
finding through [Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/scrtn7yrL22zWChPA) 📍

The pancakes were great, see the review below 😉 and my favorite part was the area were we got to sit.
It was an almost private area, separate from the open restaurant area through a glass, and it provided us with
the space to tell stories and laugh, and really enjoy our time together. It's perfect for a group of 6 to 8 people 💚

## Our Review

* The Pancakes 🥞
    * Fluffiness: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Yay! The pancakes were fluffy 😋
    * Maple Syrup: ⭐⭐⭐ - Good maple syrup and enough for the pancakes. 
    * Flavor: ⭐⭐⭐ - The flavor was nice, I would have loved more buttermilk flavor, but this would probably be a personal preference (I love buttermilk pancakes).
    * Toppings: ⭐⭐⭐ - Fruits, granola and vanilla cream. I would ask them to not add vanilla cream next time, I believe that way I would enjoy more the flavor of the pancakes with the maple syrup.
    * Extras: ⭐⭐⭐- Maple-Glazed bacon, scrambled eggs; I did not try the Maple-Glazed bacon, but heard good things from others about it.
* Drinks: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ - there are various drinks: coffee, chai, hot chocolate, tea; the tea is served in a teapot that is quite cute.  
* The Place 🌻
    * Ambiance: the ambiance was great, the table we got was lovely, we got to enjoy a bit of privacy, and did I mention that the music was great? they were playing some 80s rock 🎵 kudos to the DJ!
    * Service: the service was nice, they took good care of us, and I did not feel that the food took long to arrive.
