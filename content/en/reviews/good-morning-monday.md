## About Good Morning Monday

We found [Good Morning Monday](https://good-morning-monday-cafe.eatbu.com/) while we were exploring Google Maps
and looking for more Pancakes places. It had a [4.8 review rating in Google](https://goo.gl/maps/ZwfjHZoTFUfj1gmb7),
and it looked cozy, so we had to try!

We visited Good Morning Monday in October 2022 🍂 - at this point GoPancakes was already online, and we were
a group of six people 🫶

I found out today that the place is _temporarily closed_, and we don't know if they will open again, and so we are 
happy to have tried their pancakes.

## Our Review

* The Pancakes 🥞
    * Fluffiness: ⭐⭐
    * Maple Syrup: ⭐⭐
    * Flavor: ⭐⭐
    * Toppings: ⭐⭐⭐ - They have four different options for pancakes, with different topics each, including: fruit, apple sauce, caramelised apples, nutella, strawberries, banana, blueberry compote and sour cream, and vanilla sauce.
    * Extras: - no extras
* Drinks: ⭐⭐⭐ - Good and various options, and I remember the coffee was very good.
* The Place 🌻
    * Ambiance: The place was cozy indeed, just as the pictures in Google show, however, they do not have tables available for more than 4 people 😳 so we had to sit in two separate tables - the tables were next to each other, though 🫶🏼
    * Service: It was alright 😊
